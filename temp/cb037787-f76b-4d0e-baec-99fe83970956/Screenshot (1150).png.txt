Don't put electric machines next to water.
Electricity can move through water to you.
Firefighters don't use water to stop
electric machines burning. They use
powder to stop the fire. It isn't safe to put
your fingers in sockets or electric
machines. Electricity can move from the
socket or the machine to you. It can give
you an electric shock. Remember to be
safe with electricity! Electricity helps us to
do.many things every day and every night.
